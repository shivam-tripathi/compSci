 * Description
 *
 * Pub/Sub pattern is a wide used pattern in system design. In this problem, you need to implement a pub/sub pattern to
 * support user subscribes on a specific channel and get notification messages from subscribed channels.
 *
 * There are 3 methods you need to implement:
 *     subscribe(channel, user_id): Subscribe the given user to the given channel.
 *     unsubscribe(channel, user_id): Unsubscribe the given user from the given channel.
 *     publish(channel, message): You need to publish the message to the channel so that everyone subscribed on the
 *     channel will receive this message. Call PushNotification.notify(user_id, message) to push the message to the user.
 *
 * Example
 * subscribe("group1",  1)
 * publish("group1", "hello")
 * >> user 1 received "Hello"
 * subscribe("group1", 2)
 * publish("group1", "thank you")
 * >> user 1 received "thank you"
 * >> user 2 received "thank you"
 * unsubscribe("group2", 3)
 * >> user 3 is not in group2, do nothing
 * unsubscribe("group1", 1)
 * publish("group1", "thank you very much")
 * >> user 2 received "thank you very much"
 * publish("group2", "are you ok?")
 * >> # you don't need to push this message to anyone
 * If there are more than 1 user subscribed on the same channel, it doesn't matter the order of time users receiving the
 * message. It's ok if you push the message to user 2 before user 1.
